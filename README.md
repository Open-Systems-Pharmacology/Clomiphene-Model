# E-clomiphene-Model
Parent-metabolite PBPK model of (E)-clomiphene and its metabolites (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene, (E)-N-desethylclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene including various CYP2D6 drug-gene interactions (DGI).

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of (E)-clomiphene and its metabolites (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene, (E)-N-desethylclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene. The model was developed using plasma concentration-time and renal excretion-time profiles of various CYP2D6 activity scores from a pharmacokinetic panel study as well as from four published clinical studies. The model is able to describe and predict CYP2D6 DGIs in six different CYP2D6 activity score groups.
